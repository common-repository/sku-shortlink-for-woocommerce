Add Product SKU value in woocommerce products url 

== Description ==
This handy plugin might just be what you have searched for. It  will create URL Aliases for your WooCommerce products so you could still have your nicely Search Engine Optimized links and at the same time completely custom SKU based URLs for use in Social Media and e-quotes still linking to the same product.

<h4> Plugin has 3 prebuilt options: </h4>

* http://yourdomain.com/product/sku/[product_sku]
* http://yourdomain.com/product/[product_sku]
* http://yourdomain.com/sku/[product_sku]

We have left you option to customize your own personalized structure replacing "product" with "property", "item",  "subscription"  or anything else you wish.

<h4> How to. </h4>
Settings for this plugin you will find under 
<code>WP-Admin => WooCommerce ==> SKU Shortlink </code>
Use <code> %sku%  </code> to get your Woocommerce Product SKU
